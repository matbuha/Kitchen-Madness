## Usage

This game developed with Unity engine, with the help of [Code Monkey](https://unitycodemonkey.com/kitchenchaoscourse.php).

After I finished that course, I started to add features on my own.
then I've implemented CI-CD Pipeline to deploy it to [itch.io](https://erzelman.itch.io/kitchen-madness)
